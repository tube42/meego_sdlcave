=====================


**This is a quick and dirty port of SDLCave for Harmattan.**
**Please note that this is NOT a proper port**

This game was originally written for Maemo by Yann Benigot, `see announcement here`_
The game uses SDL for Harmattan which is `found here`_
The game also uses SDL_gfx by A. Schiffler, part of which I have included in the source code.

SDLCave for Harmattan

!! This is a quick and dirty port of SDLCave for Harmattan !!
!! Please note that this is NOT a proper port              !!



This game was originally written for Maemo by Yann Benigot, see announcement here
http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=63902

The game uses SDL for Harmattan which is found here
https://gitorious.org/sdl-1_2-harmattan

The game also uses SDL_gfx by A. Schiffler, part of which I have included in the source code.
